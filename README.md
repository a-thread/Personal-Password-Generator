# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

[My Password Generator](https://a-thread.github.io/Personal-Password-Generator/)

The assignment was to create an application that generates a random password with user-selected criteria. It needed to run in the browser and feature a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It also needed to be clean, polished, and responsive to multiple screen sizes. 

## Styling

I used Bootstrap to streamline the responsiveness of the page and to add a cleaner look with personal stylings.

## Javascript

The assignment required us to ask the user to choose a character length between 8 and 128 and to include one or more of the following:
- uppercase letters
- lowercase letters
- numbers
- special characters

I used a slider to determine the length of the password and checkboxes to interact with the user.

If the user did not choose any of the criteria, an alert would pop up telling them that they had to choose one of the character types.

### Activity Notes

When I first started this activity, I was pretty overwhelmed by JavaScript so I made [this password generator](https://github.com/a-thread/Password-Generator-Aiden) using prompts instead of checkboxes. It works really well but didn't have the look or UX that I wanted so after doing a lot of research and asking for help from my tutor, I was able to create the one you see now. Making this one with interactive checkboxes and a slider, I feel like I understand how the program works much better! I think the biggest lesson here is to keep trying, even if it seems overwhelming.
