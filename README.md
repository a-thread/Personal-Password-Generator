# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

[My Password Generator](https://a-thread.github.io/Personal-Password-Generator/)

## Description
**Password Generator** is an application that generates a random password with user-selected criteria: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers & special characters. It runs in the browser and features a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code.

I used Bootstrap to streamline the responsiveness of the page and to add a cleaner look with personal stylings.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- CSS

## Demo

If the user did not choose any of the criteria, an alert would pop up telling them that they had to choose one of the character types.

### Activity Notes

When I first started this activity, I was pretty overwhelmed by JavaScript so I made [this password generator](https://github.com/a-thread/Password-Generator-Aiden) using prompts instead of checkboxes. It works really well but didn't have the look or UX that I wanted so after doing a lot of research and asking for help from my tutor, I was able to create the one you see now. Making this one with interactive checkboxes and a slider, I feel like I understand how the program works much better! I think the biggest lesson here is to keep trying, even if it seems overwhelming.
